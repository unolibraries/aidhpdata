# Data mining AIDHP

Mining and analyzing AIDHP. 

Plain text files are from OCRed pages. These pages can be found in the American Indian Digital History Project.

Structured data is extracted from the sources and found in the data folder.

The R files contain code to parse the data. In some cases, I deleted information before parsing (tables, etc.).
